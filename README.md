# Kamstif stands for

# Khan and Mason's startup that is fun!

1. pnpm install to install the damn dependencies

2. pnpm dev to run the dev server and go to localhost:3000

quick monorepo with minimal infra mvp built in under an hour by khan j

basically, there are three endpoints

system, intake and generate. generate at the moment of coding 1:45 AM is a stub. I will connect a gpt-4o request later.

system and intake work. intake has a page.tsx with buttons for testing purposes.

due to row-level security, endpoints are not exposed. so if ur tryna hack me then fuck off.
